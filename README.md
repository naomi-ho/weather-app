### Weather App

I like to see how the weather was for earlier in the day and Apple's own app doesn't show that. So I built my own weather app. It's a terminal-themed weather app, made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

Features include:
- A search bar that allows users to input a location and returns the appropriate weather data.
- Today's hourly weather and a 14-day forecast
- Toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius (so I can communicate the weather to my American partner without having to whip out a C to F conversion calculator).

Main things that I learnt/implemented while building the website:
- Fetching and displaying data from an API (Virtual Crossing API)
- Processing JSON data
- Promises and async/await
- JS modules
